## How to Use Image Tab

There are a total of 4 sections inside the Image Tab:

- **Search Illustrator** : Search for illustrator images by entering the name of the illustration.
- **Unsplash** : Search for images directly from Unsplash. You need to create a new account on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and then create a [new application](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications). After creating your application, copy the Unsplash API key and enter it in the input box. Donâ€™t worry, as we do not store any of your data online.
- **Gen Image** : Generate images by providing Prompt and Negative Prompt.
- **Illustration Generation** : Generate illustrations using AI.

These are the tabs currently working perfectly.
